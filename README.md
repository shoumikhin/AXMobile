This is a prototype of a native [Microsoft Dynamics AX](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dynamics-ax/id663448683?mt=8) iOS app which I made in my spare time just for fun and to play with the brilliant [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa).

I tried to make it clear, testable and extensible. Hope, it will be useful for someone as a reference or inspiration.
